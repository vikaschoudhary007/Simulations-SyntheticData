# Simulations-SyntheticData

##### This Project is a reserch to take a look into different simulators and synthetic data generators available to gather information on how it can be used for machine learning algorithms especially reinforcement learning. In this study we will take a look for synthetic data generation through simulation for ML algorithms and specifally our focus will be on autonomus drone simulations.

##### The end goal of this proejct is to publish a document that contains specifications/setup instructions/use cases/data generation examples for multiple simulators.

#### 1. AirSim
